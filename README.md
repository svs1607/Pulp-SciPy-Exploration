# Pulp-SciPy-Exploration

This project looks to evaluate two techniques of solving Linear Optimization Problems and judge which one is better. The techniques used are pre-existing algorithms that can be found in the `PuLP` package and `SciPy` package on Python. In this project, both algorithms are tested using the same data, and are evaluated on ease of use as well as runtime.
